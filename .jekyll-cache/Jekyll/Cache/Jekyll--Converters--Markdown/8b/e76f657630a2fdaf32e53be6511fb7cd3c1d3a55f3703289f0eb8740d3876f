I"Í<p><a href="https://blog.kwintenp.com/">Kwinten Pisman</a> and me were working on a workshop this weekend with the focus on Reactive applications with <a href="http://angular.io">Angular 2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs">RXJS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ngrx">@ngrx</a>. Something that canâ€™t miss in a reactive workshop are real-time updates. The application we are trying to make real-time is the <a href="http://winecellar.surge.sh">winecellar</a> app (you can register an account here if you want to test it).</p>

<p>To make this application real-time we changed some code in the node.js backend, but thatâ€™s out of scope for this post. 
The cool thing is, that we only needed <strong>6 lines of code</strong> to make the frontend completely real-time.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s a small demo. Both computers are signed in with the same account. At the left screen, wines are being added and removed, and in the right screen youâ€™ll see the changes happening real-time.

<h2 id="the-winecellar-app">The winecellar app</h2>

<p>The winecellar application is a simple application with only a few features, but we overengineered it on purpose to make it work for largescale applications.
You can find the open-source code of the winecellar project here: <a href="https://github.com/brechtbilliet/winecellar">frontend, (realtime branch)</a> and <a href="https://github.com/brechtbilliet/WineCellarBackend">backend</a>. Beware, the backend might be a little quick and dirty ;)</p>

<h2 id="what-part-of-the-application-should-be-real-time">What part of the application should be real-time?</h2>

<ul>
<li>All the actions that will update the content in the database eventually should push notifications to all clients except the one sending them.</li>
<li>Even the filter should be real-time. (Eg. when filtering on "Chateau pomerol", and somebody adds that wine, we want to update our filtered results real-time)</li>
</ul>

<p>But why did we made something like that real-time? Actually, <strong>just because we can</strong>! It doesnâ€™t really make sense that a user is logged in twice right? We did it for the purpose of the workshop.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-we-manage-to-make-it-real-time">How did we manage to make it real-time?</h2>

<p>First, let me give you a little bit of information about how the winecellar really works.</p>

<p>Like said before we use @ngrx/store as our redux implementation. It is a redux library that we use to maintain the state of our application. Basically, you can see it as a client-side store of all our wines and other state. We use that particular store as a single-source-of-truth. We will send actions towards that store which will update the state with pure functions called reducers.</p>

<p>In the following scheme you can see the unidirectional dataflow of redux: The view sends actions to the store which will update the state and then update the view.
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brechtbilliet/brechtbilliet.github.io/master/_posts/realtimein6lines/redux.png" alt="Redux" /></p>

<p>Letâ€™s say that we want to add a wine. when we add a wine, we send a XHR request to the backend and send an action to the store, like you can see in the snippet below. That is already how to wine application works</p>

<pre><code class="language-typescript">add(wine: Wine): void {
    this.http.post(`${API_URL}/wines`, wine, this.authorizedHttpOptions())
        .map((res: Response) =&gt; res.json())
    	.subscribe(resp =&gt;
    		this.store.dispatch({type: DATA_WINES_ADD, payload: {wine:resp}})
		);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This doesnâ€™t have anything to do with real-time, right?! You are right, it doesnâ€™tâ€¦ But what if our backend can send Redux actions as well? If the backend can push redux actions to the frontend, then we can make it real-time with very little effort.</p>

<p>For every REST call where something in the database gets updated, we can send a redux action to all the clients which are logged in with the same username (except for ourselves)</p>

<p><strong>These are the 6 lines of code, that we need to make our frontend 100% real-time.</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-typescript">import * as io from "socket.io-client";
// connect with socket.io and listen to redux actions
connect(): void {
    this.store.select(state =&gt; state.data.authentication.jwtToken)
    	.take(1).subscribe((token: string) =&gt; {
	        let socket = io(BACKEND, {query: "jwttoken=" + token});
	        socket.on("UPDATE_REDUX", action =&gt; this.store.dispatch(action));
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is a simplified example of what happens on the backend when we add a wine, for instance.</p>

<pre><code class="language-typescript">@Post("/")
public post(@Req()req: Request, @Res() res: Response): void {
    let userId = handleAuth(req, res);
    new Wine(req.body).save((error, response) =&gt; {
        ...
        // emit a socket.io event to the client
        // which contains the redux action
        this.pushToClient(userId, req, {type: DATA_WINES_ADD, payload: {wine: response}});
        // return the new user
        res.send(response);
    });
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="check-the-devtools">Check the devtools</h2>
<p>In The devtools below youâ€™ll see the actions being dispatched during the lifecycle of the application. These actions can be triggered manually or real-time. Be sure to check them out at <a href="https://github.com/ngrx/store-devtools">https://github.com/ngrx/store-devtools</a>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The data that is managed by redux can be easily made real-time by making the backend dispatch redux actions to the frontend. 
That way, we can make our application real-time in matter of minutes.
