I"û<p>The people that are used to read my articles will quickly realise that this is not the type of articles I generally write.
Since Iâ€™m passionate about this subject, Iâ€™m going to write about it anyway. Bear with me, you might take away
something from it. If not, at least you gave it a shot, right? Iâ€™m writing a book as we speak about my life and career as
a software professional, not sure if Iâ€™ll ever publish it, but consider this a very slimmed down version of some chapters of that book.</p>
