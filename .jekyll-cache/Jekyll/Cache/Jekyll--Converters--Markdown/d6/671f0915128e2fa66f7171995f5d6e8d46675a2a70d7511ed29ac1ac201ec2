I"h<p>Sometimes forms in Angular can be a pain, and some of us have been struggling with them since the beta phases of Angular2.
First there was only the template driven forms approach, and then later on the Angular core team
introduced Reactive forms. Both solutions still exist today, but the community sold Reactive forms as a best practice and they basically told
us to stay away from template driven forms.
The reasoning behind this was:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reactive forms are easier to unit-test.</li>
  <li>Less chance of 2-way databinding on models directly.</li>
  <li>Reactive apiâ€™s like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">valueChanges</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">statusChanges</code> returned observables for us.</li>
  <li>Validation was supposed to be better, but there is some debate around that topic.</li>
</ul>
