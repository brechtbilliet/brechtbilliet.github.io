This is the second non-technical article I'm writing. It's about a chain of thoughts that occurs in a lot of people their minds
that come out of their comfort zone and become rolemodels or influence people in a way. That's not even true...
I believe it happens to all people.
It's about us not feeling competent enough, not good enough for the value we want to bring.
We feel like we are cheating people that are lying about who we are. We feel like imposters, we feel like we
pretend to be someone that we are not. We don't feel good enough, not up to the standards we want to sell.
We usually compare ourselves with people that we worship: in business, in life, in love, in sports, in everything.

This tricky thing is called **imposter syndrome** and even though it isn't a disease or an actual physical or mental syndrome,
it can influence a person lot. In a way, we should all experience imposter syndrome because it keeps us humble, but, 
it can really hold us back as well. Feeling like an imposter is perfectly normal, and I believe it's part of our path.

Once again, let me go back to my personal experience, where I felt like an imposter in many parts of my life.
Remember your first girlfriend? You felt like you won the lottery right?! You felt like she was way out of your league.
She was prettier, smarter, more confident and you were just you... Well, at least I was just me and I was terrified.
Every day, I thought she was going to wake up realising that she could do better. I kept pinching myself to check if
I was dreaming or not.
That was the first experience with imposter syndrome: Why didn't I feel good enough?

My second experience was when I started my high school education and I didn't thought I was smart enough.
I studied really hard for my first exam and I failed miserably. I quickly realised that this wasn't the level I knew from
middle school and I thought about giving up. By changing my mindset I actually didn't have too much trouble finishing my
degree and I graduaded as the opposite of the imposter: The arrogant and ignorent.

I felt like I was the expert, the guru, a competent software engineer that knew everything.
That feeling lasted for about an hour after I actually went to work for a company. I was an incompetent rookie with a big mouth and
I quickly felt as an imposter again. I was pretending to be someone I was not. Actually, I was just a junior software engineer pretending to be a senior one,
and that's totally fine. Most of the engineers that are just graduated are especially proud and mainly that is because they are passionate
and want to prosper.

Years went by and I created a certain drive that made me ambitious in what I did:
"Developing web applications and coaching companies in creating better web applications".

When I gave my first training ever, I invited a few freelance engineers that I knew at my home, and I created a one day training about *single page applications*.
I was 24 years old at the time, and they all had more than a decade of engineering experience. I felt like an imposter but they didn't knew a lot about the subject because it was new,
so they actually learned something and they were quite positive about the training. No imposter syndrome at the end of the day.

I stayed passionate about "single page applications" and not much later I was giving trainings in a framework called **angular.js** in various companies.
**Angular.js** was a framework that was commonly used to write these so called *single page applications*.
I had only months of experience in that framework, so I felt like an imposter as well, but after giving that training to more and more people
I lost that feeling of being an imposter. They were just local companies that I helped and I felt like I was bringing them value.

I met a guy named Davy who asked me to be a mentor for his *angular.js* training program. Davy his name was well known in the community and who was I?
Why would I bring value? I wasn't famous?! I didn't have loads of experience in mentoring and basically I wasn't confident enough. I was the imposter!
After all, that mentorship went really great and I was able to help a lot of people so I was able to shake the imposter syndrome for that situation.

I started a blog in 2016 and I started writing about Angular 2 modals because I was struggling with that topic at the time.
Why would anyone read my articles? After months I got hundreds of page views every day of people reading the "imposter" his articles.

When I gave my first public talk and my first public training I had imposter syndrome written all over me, but I stayed humble, and I realised that people
can keep on learning. I too worshipped people and I never thought I was going to be good enough to give trainings next to these people on conferences.
But I did, these people became friends and I realised that it's not about being an expert or a guru. It's about helping people and sharing expertise.
Once you realise it's normal to make mistakes and that you are not a walking manual you start to realise that you are not an imposter.
you are helping people and you try to make a difference. 

It's fine to call yourself an expert, a coach, an architect, whatever. But we should realise that we need to keep learning.

Every time I hit a new career point I felt like an imposter, and at the same time I believed in the value I brought. That's
a hard balance to find. In the training I'm currently creating I once again feel like an imposter.

I'm selling an **Angular Best Practices Training** to people. Who am I to determine these best practices.
Why on earth should people want to learn these best practices from me?

Well I started with Angular before it was released and I have tons of experience with it: In huge projects, in more than 50 of projects (maybe 100)
and even though I coached and gave trainings, I was there in the field every single time. I've learned a lot, I've seen a lot, and I want to share that experience.
I call the things that I've learned **Best Practices** because they work for me, and I saw them work for big projects. I never said that every one should consider them as the ultimate truth.
That would make me a hypocrite. There are multiple ways of creating these projects and even though I feel like an imposter at times. I feel in my core that I
can bring a huge amount of value with that training.

## Conclusion

Imposter syndrome is normal, and it's not bad as long as it doesn't hold us back.
Say humble, realise we can keep learning for ever, but also realise that the people that you see as
rock star engineers are just people. They are nothing more or less than you and me. Keep feeling like an imposter.
Because it makes you humble and it invites you to keep on learning. Just know that you can achieve whatever you want.
